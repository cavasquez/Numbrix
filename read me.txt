This numbrix project currently allows one to play a game of Numbrix. In order to start a game, the player
must go to File -> New Game. This will allow the player to choose a file from which to load the game.
The file formatting is as follows:

# of rows (or columns)
x_1 y_1 value_1
x_2 y_2	value_2
.
.
.
x_i y_i value_i 

where i is an arbitrary number no greater than # of rows * # of columns. I understand that the formatting
had the "origin" of the gridstart at the bottom left corner, but since we are allowed to format the text 
file as wanted, the "origin" is the top left corner.

After filling in the grid, click on the "Finish" button. Doing so will produce a message in the bottom pane
informing the player on correctness of grid or errors encountered. Once done, the bottom pane will inform
the player the process needed to start a new game (file -> new game or file -> reset).

The pane to the right will let the player know their game history (inputs and modifications).

To input a value, simply click on the cell you wish to modify and type in the number you wish
to place into the cell. To delete a value, simply click on the cell you wish to remove a value from
and hit backspace until there is no value left.

Two sample girds are provided in example1.txt and example2.txt
example1.txt contains the grid from the project specification
example2.txt contains the sample grid from the discussion
